# Iteration Plan

The most important use case would be the search for room because this is the first step that the students will do.
The risk of this case would be the information that the students are looking for. For instance if a student is searching for a single
and the search for room is not showing the singles, or it shows the wrong information. About the coverage search for room is covering the most information 
in the use cases. Since search for room is the first and important step that students will go for it, so it is very crucial and plays a big role in the app. 

The second important use case that we are working on it is View room. Students are viewing the rooms and will be able to leave a review note.
Students can favourite and save the rooms too. The risky part in this use case would be the students can't view the rooms or they are not able to leave a review.
This can also apply for the students are looking for the review, and they can't see the review. Either the information are not saved or not accurate. 
Since this use case also uses much information it also helps a lot of the jobs get done. The critical parts would be displaying the rooms 
and updating the favorites and saved information. 

For the next phase, we need to work on the saving favorite rooms, being able to save reviews even when a new search is done,
and adding the option to add photos and add a rating in a review. For now, the photos are the same for every room, but we need
to be able to add photos to certain rooms so that it only appears in the room profile of the room the photos belong to. We
also want to work on the look of the app and screens so that it can look more appealing. Working on saving the reviews is the
most important because there would be no point in the user writing a review if it is not saved when a new search is done.
Saving favorites would be very helpful for users to save rooms they like, so they can go back and find it. Although, right now,
our room library is not that big, realistically, it would be big, so it would be useful.
