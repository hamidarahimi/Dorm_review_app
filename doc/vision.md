 # Vision

The target audience for the dorm review app is Vassar students who live on campus. During the room draw process, 
students are only able to see the rooms available in the house and section that they are entering the room draw for. 
They cannot see how the room looks like, just if it is available and how many students can live it in. There are maps
of each floor of the house whose room draw the student is participating in, but it is not very descriptive. So, with 
this app, students will be able to see for themselves how each room looks like and how past residents liked the rooms. 
Then when it is time for the room draw and they can choose whether they want to stay or switch houses and they can 
confidently choose a room that they will like, or at least they will be prepared for how it looks like.

## Main features
First, there will be an easy-to-use searching system to look for rooms and filtering/sorting option to search by the user's specific preferences.
Each room will have their own page/profile where students can see pictures, reviews, and ratings for the room. Students
will also be able to see if the room is available to choose from. They will also be able to save rooms in their favorites
so they can go back to it or remember for the room draw or to have multiple options, plus a recently viewed section, 
in case they forgot to favorite it or just want to go back to view it again. Additionally, there will be the option to 
upvote or like a review, whether it is a student who found it helpful or a past resident that agrees and wants to 
validate it.

## Student looking for a room
The student will be able to choose what house, what floor, and what type of room they are looking for to help in there
search for a room to choose in the draw.
- choose house and other preferences
- read reviews and look at pictures
- search for specific rooms
- favorite room they like

## Past Resident
It can be a past or current resident, but basically it is some who has access to the room and is living or has lived
there so that they can give their review or upload picture of the room to better "inform" future/possible residents.
- enter room info
- write room review
- leave a rating 
- upload pictures

## Housing/ROC/ResLife
Since it is most likely that not everyone on campus puts information into the app,
then we can get basic information from Housing to give students some idea/info of the room.
Also, the student can know if the room is even available for them to choose from.
- managing rooms: All the rooms that are usable for Vassar students will be posted through the system.
- enter availability: The system will be show only the ones that are available.
